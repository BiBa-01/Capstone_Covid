    "\n",

    "\n",
    "***Background Information:*** Since the only feature with essentially no missing values, i.e. daily vaccinations, has been generated by a 7-day rolling/smoothing window technique (for more details see notekook 3) we won't look further into predictions based on this feature, especially since the imputed values cannot easily be identified. Therefore, we will concentrate on total vaccinations, daily vaccinations (raw) and people vaaccinated (partially/fully and fully vaccinated). These feature have 38% to 62% missing values from the perspective of the entire dataset, i.e. all countries (see notebook 1). The number of missing values might be attributed to certain countries not supplying certain data. Therefore, the first step is to check this out and possibly identify countries that have few missing numbers with respect to these features, which are suitable for modelling. We start by investigating the following countries: Germany, UK, USA, Israel, India, Russia and China.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following features won't be considered:\n",
    "+ % And ppm columns are not of key interest since we want to predict the absolute numbers of vaccinations, their upward trend and their daily fluctuations, and they are essentially covered in corresponding 'absolute value' columns.\n",
    "+ The vaccine features are not relevant for predicting vaccination number as the information is not detailed enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KEY FINDINGS**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reagarding total vaccinations and daily_vaccinations (raw):\n",
    "+ For Germany and Israel we have no missing values from December onwards. Hence, we will start our investigations with these 2 countries (PRIO1).\n",
    "+ India has very few missing values from mid-January onwards. We can impute these numbers and then investigate India as well (PRIO2). it is unlikely that there were no vaccinations on these days, so we will consider imputing from the previous day(s) (with regard to daily vaccinations). In order to decide how to proceed we need to look into the data in more detail (later).\n",
    "+ The UK and USA reported sporadically during December 2020 but continuously from mid-January 2021 onwards. Hence we will have less data, but a continuous series and will investigate these countries with PRIO2.\n",
    "+ There are too many missing values for China and Russia to sensibly impute data. Therefore, currently it will not be possible to make predictions for these countries. with respect to the above key objective. There is more data available for daily vaccinations, but since this feature is imputed we would need to check out if we can reverse engineer it to identify the imputed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding people vaccinated (partially/fully and fully vaccinated):\n",
    "+ With respect to people vaccinated (partially and fully) there is enough data available for certain countries with few missing values (continuous, mainly in December and early January). Hence, this could be analysed and predicted, but since this is a mixture of partially and fully vaccinated people the picture won#t be complete without this additional information.\n",
    "+ Not enough data for people fully vaccinated is availabe yet, as 4-6 weeks delay between 1st and 2nd shot. Hence this cannot be analysed or predicted as yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we will start by investigating daily vaccinations (raw) worldwide and for Germany, Israel. It should be noted that the worldwide accumulated data has, of course, no missing values, but in essence the missing values for certain countries are masked. This is undesirable, but nonetheless a real world example and thus we will include the global progress as well as the 2 selected countries."

    "\n",
    "**KEY FINDINGS**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The first plot shows the worldwide daily vaccinations (raw) versus the daily vaccinations (7-day window/smoothing) and it can clearly bee seen that the imputed values are at the higher end of the raw values. The second plot shows the rolling-7-day average of the daily vaccinations (raw) in comparison to the original daily vaccinations (raw). Here we clearly see it reflecting the mean. Thus, we can once again confirm the discrepancy between the total vaccinations (and daily vaccinations(raw)) and the daily vaccinations (with imputation oof missing numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The third plot shows the daily vaccinations (raw) for Germany and Israel confirming that all three timeseries (incl. worlwide) show an expected upward trend with most likely weekly seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Plot four shows a monthly comparison for the data for each of the three timeseries and confirms the above findings. It also nicely highlights the similarities and differences between the three series.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The distribution pattern in plot five show the right skewedness of the three time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Anf finally, lag plots (1, 7 and 30 days) show clear positive trends, whereby the correlation declines with the number of lags and from visual inspection appears to be weaker for Israel. Since the correlation is linear in all 3 cases an autoregressive model is probably the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, since for all three series mean and variance are time dependent we have trend and seasonality so we don't have stationary time series. The next step will be to decompose and detrend the series."

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1) All 3 timeseries show a positive trend and a weekly seasonality.\n",
    "2) All 3 timeseries were successfully detrended to achieve stationarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** It is not clear whether the trends are linear or exponential, additional analysis would be required. Thinking about the process in general one could hope for a linear trend in the first months, then maybe an exponential trend for a while, before eventually becoming stationary as the world. population is vaccinated and requires re-vaccination (with then sufficient vaccine quantities available). And, looking at the detrended series it can be speculated that possibly trend stationarity may not be given for data in March. We will keep this in mind moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebooks we will model the 3 timeseries with focus on Holt-Winter's triple exponential smoothing, seasonal ARIMA and FB Prophet.\n",
    "\n",
    "***REASONING:***\n",
    "Simple exponential smoothing and Winter's exponential smoothing will not be applied due to their specific requirements regarding trend and seasonality. Triple exponential smoothing tolerates both and is hence best suited for our timeseries. With our newly generated detrended time series we will further investigate an autoregressive SARIMA model. If successful we can advance to a SARIMAX or vector-autoregressive (VAR) model allowing for multivariate time series (i.e. lag observations from other variables). Alternatively, if facing challenges we can turn to FB Prophet, an additive regression model with changepoint analysis, which can handle non-stationary data and allows for the inclusion of additional regressors, such as holidays and other metadata (e.g. day of week). Another allternative would be a neural network (LSTM), however this would require a lot of data, which is currently not available with COVID-19 vaccinations only having started about 100 days ago. So, this will be placed on hold for now, since interpolation of the daily data would not suffice either, but might certainly be an option in the future. And, we might then also include FB Neural Prophet.\n",
