    "### 1.1 COVID-19 pandemic\n",
    "\n",
    "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which is caused by a new coronavirus and was first detected in Q4 2019. As the disease spread around the world it was declared a pandemic early in 2020. Now, a year later (March 2021), the effects of the global pandemic continues to affect and change the lives of each and everyone across the world. Whereas most people who contract the disease will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment, especially the elderly, and those with underlying medical problems (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cancer) are more likely to develop very serious conditions. The way forward in fighting the disease it to vaccinated the world population. The progress of this process over the last 3 months is what we will investigatee in this EDA.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2 COVID-19 vaccines\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed at which the first COVID-19 vaccines were developed as a response to the pandemic was extraordinary. Overall it took less than a year to successfully develop and approve several vaccines, a timeframe significantly shorter than usually observed for the development of new vaccines. It is important that development of further vaccines continues, as it does, as a very large share of the world population will need to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in order to become immune to the virus, so that we can successfully combat the pandemic. In addition, the appearance of more and more mutated versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus calls for the development of additional vaccines to offer a wide bandwidth of starting points to also sucessfully combat these mutants. As such, one of the key challenges is to vaccinate people around the world. ['OurWorldinData'](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) create and make available a daily updated dataset on international COVID-19 vaccinations to track these efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of vaccines developed to target SARS-CoV-2, RNA based vaccines and cell based vaccines (recombinant and inactivated) and protein subunit based vaccines. An overview of the different types can be found [here](https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/how-do-vaccines-work/#types).\n",
    "\n",
    "mRNA VACCINES: mRNA vaccines contain mRNA with instructions for making the spike protein. This protein is expressed the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and required to enter cells. Upon vaccination the spike protein is produced and will be recognised by the immune system as foreign. This results in the production of antibodies and activated T cells (white blood cells) which will attack it. This information is stored by the immune system so that if it encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus again it can act fast to eliminate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "RECOMBINANT VACCINES: Recombinant vaccines are made up of another virus (which cannot reproduce and cause disease) that has been modified to contain the gene for making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein is expressed the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and required to enter cells. Upon vaccination the spike protein is produced and will be recognised by the immune system as foreign. This results in the production of antibodies and activated T cells (white blood cells) which will attack it. This information is stored by the immune system so that if it encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus again it can act fast to eliminate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several institutions maintain websites on which they list COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being developed. The [WHO Vaccine Tracker](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines) is one of them and provides a concise overview. Additional information on COVID-19 vaccines by the WHO can be found [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).\n",

Two chinese vaccines CanSino and Anhui Zhifei Longcom are not currently covered by the dataset. It can also be noted that some vaccines are approved accross numerous countries, whereas others are predominantly appoved in only a limited number of countries. The above overview of vaccines is not exhaustive and there may be some approved vaccines that are not included. And, of course, the approval of new vaccines is a dynamic progress, so the overview only reflects the status as of 31st March 2021.\n",

    "IMPORTANT NOTE! Different vaccines are approved for use in different countries and thus influence which vaccines and how many are available in each country. In addition the available is strongly influenced by the production capacity of each vaccine.\n",
